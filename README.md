# admixture_pipeline
This is the code used for data analysis for my final project.
Most data wrangling was performed using the bash shell script (run.sh) and most graphics was done using the R script (graphing.R). 
Packages / softwares used for the analysis can be found in the 'Web Resources' section of the paper and their use is described in the 'Materials and Methods'. The files from the 1KGP were downloaded pre-phased using SHAPEIT2 from the Imperial SSH. Other files used in the analysis were obtained as described in the setup.sh bash shell script.
